This is a single page application (SPA) website built using React for the front-end and Strapi, an open-source headless content management system (CMS), for the back-end deployed on Railway, with media files hosted on Cludinary.

It was my first time using a CMS and I was happily surprised by how easy and intuitive it felt to create collection types and access them through the API endpoints.
