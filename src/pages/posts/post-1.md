I recently Rebuilt my portfolio site in Astro, a blazingly fast and ultra-performant static site generator, with excellent documentation and a supportive Discord community.

I used markdown files to write my content, Astro's image component to optimise my images, and its easy-to-use file-based routing to generate new routes. My site now has a perfect lighthouse score; very impressed!

I'm excited to continue learning more about Astro and using it in future projects.
