A React movie app inspired by Letterboxd, built using the TMDB API to fetch movie data, this project demonstrates usage of React Router, state management, API fetching, pagination, and Framer Motion.

This project allows users to browse and search for movies, view detailed information about each movie, and add movies to their watchlist. I learned a lot about React, Framer Motion, and working with REST APIs while working on this project.
