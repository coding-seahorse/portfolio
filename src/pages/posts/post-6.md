This was a project I made that serves as a 'coming soon' landing page for an online business, built in vanilla JavaScript.
Although this was a simple website, it serves to demonstrate my understanding of DOM manipulation as well as being able to use JavaScript's built-in Date object.
It was also my first time using Vanta.js, a javascript library that allows you to add animated backgrounds to a website.
